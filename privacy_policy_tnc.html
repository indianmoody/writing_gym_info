    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Gaurav Bishnoi built the Writing Gym app as
                  a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by
                  Gaurav Bishnoi at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
                  Writing Gym unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                  may require you to provide us with certain personally
                  identifiable information. The information that
                  I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                </p> <!----> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
                  I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                  I collect data and information (through third party
                  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                  configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                  the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                  statistics.
                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                  choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                  portions of this Service.
                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  I may employ third-party companies and
                  individuals due to the following reasons:
                </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                  I want to inform users of this Service
                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.

                  These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.

                <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                              By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                              automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                              that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                              allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                              our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                              extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                              to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                              versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                              database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                              to it, still belong to Gaurav Bishnoi.
                            </p> <p>
                              Gaurav Bishnoi is committed to ensuring that the app is
                              as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                              reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                              its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                              charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                              clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                            </p> <p>
                              The Writing Gym app stores and processes personal data that
                              you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                              Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                              access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                              not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                              removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                              official operating system of your device. It could make your
                              phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                              compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                              that the Writing Gym app won’t work properly or at all.
                            </p> <!----> <p>
                              You should be aware that there are certain things that
                              Gaurav Bishnoi will not take responsibility for. Certain
                              functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                              internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                              by your mobile network provider, but Gaurav Bishnoi
                              cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                              functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                              have any of your data allowance left.
                            </p> <p></p> <p>
                              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                              should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                              mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                              be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                              the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                              other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                              responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                              charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                              (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                              you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                              using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                              received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                            </p> <p>
                              Along the same lines, Gaurav Bishnoi cannot always take
                              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                              make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                              battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                              Gaurav Bishnoi cannot accept responsibility.
                            </p> <p>
                              With respect to Gaurav Bishnoi’s responsibility for your
                              use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                              bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                              updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                              to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                              to you. Gaurav Bishnoi accepts no liability for any
                              loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                              relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                            </p> <p>
                              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                              currently available on iOS – the requirements for
                              system(and for any additional systems we
                              decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                              and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                              using the app. Gaurav Bishnoi does not promise that it
                              will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                              and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                              installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                              accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                              also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                              it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                              Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                              rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                              (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                              from your device.

You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.

            f. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
